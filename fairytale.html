<p align="center"><b><span style="font-size:30px;">T</span>he Fairytale World 
is the world inhabited by figures from fairytales. It is a collection of numerous realms 
that each align with one or more fairytales. The entire world's existence depends on the 
continuation of the stories, which schools like Ever After High prepare each generation 
to do. In most cultures, there is no clear line separating myth from folk or fairy tale; 
all these together form the literature of preliterate societies. Fairy tales may be 
distinguished from other folk narratives such as legends (which generally involve belief 
in the veracity of the events described) and explicit moral tales, including beast fables.</p>

<p align="center">A fairy tale, fairytale, wonder tale, magic tale, fairy story or Märchen 
is an instance of folklore genre that takes the form of a short story. Such stories typically 
feature mythical entities such as dwarfs, dragons, elves, fairies and Peris, giants, Divs, gnomes, 
goblins, griffins, mermaids, talking animals, trolls, unicorns, or witches, and usually magic or 
enchantments. Travel between the realms happens by use of portals. It is revealed to be ruled by 
Snow White and her daughter Apple White, though different Realms have their own leaders.Ever 
After — The realm in which Ever After High is located. This realm is associated with the classic fairy tales.</p>

<p align="center">On a night of glamour, you want everything to be fairy-tale perfect. Although the fairy tale is a 
distinct genre within the larger category of folktale, the definition that marks a work as a fairy tale is a source of 
considerable dispute. The term itself comes from the translation of Madame D'Aulnoy's Conte de fées, first used in her 
collection in 1697.The Fairy Tale World takesa uniquely global perspective and broadens the international, cultural, and 
critical scope of fairy-tale studies.</p>

<p align="center">The oral tradition of the fairy tale came long before the written page. Tales were told or enacted 
dramatically, rather than written down, and handed down from generation to generation. Because of this, the history of 
their development is necessarily obscure and blurred. Fairy tales appear, now and again, in written literature throughout 
literate cultures, as in The Golden Ass, which includes Cupid and Psyche (Roman, 100–200 AD), or the Panchatantra 
(India 3rd century BC), but it is unknown to what extent these reflect the actual folk tales even of their own time. The 
stylistic evidence indicates that these, and many later collections, reworked folk tales into literary forms.
